    "LIME stands for Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations and was developed by Ribeiro et.al. in 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook LIME is going to be used to generate explanations for an image classification task. \n",
    "The basic idea applying LIME is to understand why a deep neural network predicts that an instance (image) belongs to a certain class (labrador in this case). \n",
    "This notebook is based on previous work by Cristian Arteaga, [arteagac.github.io](https://arteagac.github.io)\n",

    "## LIME explanations\n",
    "The following figure illustrates the basic idea behind LIME. The figure shows light and dark gray areas which are the decision boundaries for the classes for each (x1,x2) pairs in the dataset. LIME is able to provide explanations for the predictions of an individual record (blue dot). The  explanations are created by generating a new dataset of perturbations around the instance to be explained (colored markers around the blue dot). The output or class of each generated perturbation is predicted with the machine-learning model (colored markers inside and outside the decision boundaries). The importance of each perturbation is determined by measuring its distance from the original instance to be explained. These distances are converted to weights by mapping the distances to a zero-one scale using a kernel function (see color scale for the weights). All this information: the new generated dataset, its class predictions and its weights are used to fit a simpler model, such as a linear model (blue line), that can be interpreted. The attributes of the simpler model, coefficients for the case of a linear model, are then used to generate explanations.  \n",
